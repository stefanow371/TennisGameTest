# About the solution:
**I decided to build the structure of the project in my own way, so there are currently classes:**

### Folder: A_Winner_Is_Declared
1. **Class: Receiver_Is_A_Winner** 
-- all of the cases where a receiver wins
2. **Class: Server_Is_A_Winner**
 -- all of the cases where a servers wins

### Folder: Deuce_And_Advantage_Is_Handled
1. **Class: Given_The_Score_Is_40_40** 
-- a case where server / receiver gets advantage

### Folder: Resources
1. **Class: Helper** 
-- a small class that contains a message instruction for assertions
2. **Class: Scores**
-- contains all of the possible scores

### Folder: The_Score_Should_Increment_Once_A_Player_Scores
1. **Class: Receiver_Earns_A_Point**
-- all of the test cases where receiver score a point
2. **Class: Server_Earns_A_Point** 
-- all of the test cases where server score a point
